### Candy Crush

This is a game based on Candy Crush/Bejeweled that you can play in your terminal. It follows an activity that's part of the App Academy Open curriculum, although I added some extra functionality to it to make it more similar to the actual Candy Crush game. The game is made with JavaScript. According to App Academy, the project is designed to help the student master:
1) object-oriented programming in Javascript and
2) testing-driven development (with Mocha and Chai)

## How to play

* Clone and enter the repo
* Run `npm install`
* Run `node game.js`

Use the following commands to play:

* `w` - up
* `s` - down
* `a` - left
* `d` - right
* `x` - select
* `q` - quit the game
